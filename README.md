# Neural Networks

Experiments with Neural Networks

When to Use Each Type of Neural Network?

## Feedforward NN (FNN)

**Patterns & relationships**	

Image recognition, multiplication modeling, spam detection

## Recurrent NN (RNN)

**Time-series & predictions**	

Stock prices, currency rates, speech recognition

## Convolutional NN (CNN)

**Image processing**	

Face recognition, object detection

## Transformers (like GPT)

**Advanced language tasks**

Chatbots, text generation, machine translation
